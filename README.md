### Title

* Solar System Graph Database

### About / Synopsis

* The purpose of this project is to demonstrate Neo4j's NoSQL graph development and querying capabilities. This is demonstrating using information about Earth's solar system. Relationships between nodes (e.g. planets, human and the sun) are created, queried and displayed as both graphs and tables

### Detailed Description 

*A Solar_System_Graph_DB_Labels.json file has been provided which contains all the nodes and property values utilized by the graph

*A Solar_System_Graph_DB_relationships.csv file has been provided which contains all the relationships within nodes of the same label (e.g. inter-planet relationships) and nodes of different labels (e.g. planet-to-Sun) utilized by the graph

*Screenshots of the graph have been provided in this README.md file

*Sample Cypher No-SQL query commands have also been included for reference
